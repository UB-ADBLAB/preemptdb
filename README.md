# PreemptDB: Low-Latency Scheduling via Userspace Interrupts

PreemptDB a database engine that supports lightweight userspace preemptible transactions enabled by Intel x86 user interrupt (uintr).
PreemptDB allows high-priority, short-transactions to quickly preempt and pause long-running, low-priority transactions which is resumed after the short-transaction concludes.
